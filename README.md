# Project: MLOps Bootcamp

This project was created as part of an intensive MLOps bootcamp aimed at setting up a machine learning environment and effectively managing versioned experiment results. The project is a part of my effort to enhance skills in machine learning and DevOps.

## Course

### Course Description

The goal of the course was to master key MLOps tools and learn how to create and manage model training pipelines. Throughout the course, the following topics were covered:

- Introduction to MLOps: fundamental concepts and principles.
- Setting up the environment for working with data and models.
- Using Airflow to create and manage pipelines.
- Training multiple models concurrently using Airflow.
- Leveraging MLFlow for model and metric logging.
- Final project: applying the acquired knowledge in practice.

### Technologies Used

During the course, I familiarized myself with and utilized the following technologies and tools:

- **Airflow**: for creating and managing model training pipelines.
- **MLFlow**: for logging models, metrics, and experiments.
- **S3**: for storing and managing data.
- **DVC**: for versioning data.
- **Python**: primary programming language for pipeline development and data processing.

### Additional Details

During the learning process, I successfully completed the following tasks and project works:

- **Environment Setup**: deployed an environment for working with data and models, using Miniconda for dependency management and Python environment setup.
- **Data Handling**: developed scripts to fetch data from various sources and prepare it for model training.
- **Pipeline Development**: created model training pipelines using Airflow, including parallel training of multiple models.
- **Experiment Logging and Management**: used MLFlow to log models, parameters, and metrics, and to create parent and child experiments.
